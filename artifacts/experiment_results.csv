* **Extraction:** Data will be extracted from the identified sources using APIs, web scraping, or direct database connections. Automated scripts will be implemented for regular data updates. Data validation checks will be performed to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
* **Cleaning and Transformation:** Raw data will be cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data will be transformed into a standardized format suitable for analysis and calculations. This includes adjusting for stock splits and dividends.
* **Storage:** Processed data will be stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for efficient querying and retrieval.  A time-series database may be considered for optimizing historical market data access.


**3. Financial Ratio Calculation:**

The system will calculate the following key financial ratios:

* **Qualitative Analysis:** Sentiment scores derived from news and social media will be incorporated into the overall score.
* **Recommendation Generation:** Based on the combined score, the system will generate one of the following recommendations:
    * **Buy:**  A strong positive outlook based on both quantitative and qualitative factors.
    * **Hold:** A neutral outlook, suggesting maintaining the current position.
    * **Sell:** A negative outlook, indicating potential downside risk.
* **Risk Tolerance:** User profiles will include risk tolerance levels (e.g., conservative, moderate, aggressive). The recommendation logic will adjust based on the user's risk profile.


**6. User Interface:**

* **Dashboard:** A central dashboard will display an overview of the user's portfolio, including current holdings, performance, and recommendations.
* **Stock Search:** Users can search for specific stocks and view detailed information, including financial ratios, historical performance, news sentiment, and the system's recommendation.
