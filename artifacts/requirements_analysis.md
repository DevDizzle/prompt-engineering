## Requirement Analysis Document: Stock Recommendation System

**1. Data Sources:**

* **Real-time Market Data:**  This includes current stock prices, trading volume, bid/ask spreads, and other relevant market indicators. Sources like IEX Cloud, Alpha Vantage, or a direct connection to a brokerage API will be used.
* **Historical Market Data:**  Historical stock prices, trading volume, and other relevant data for at least the past 5 years. Sources like Yahoo Finance, Quandl, or specialized financial data providers will be considered.
* **Financial Statements:** Quarterly and annual reports (10-K, 10-Q) from companies, sourced from the SEC's EDGAR database or commercial providers like Refinitiv or Bloomberg.
* **News Articles and Social Media Feeds:**  Data from reputable news sources (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal) and social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, StockTwits) will be used for sentiment analysis.


**2. Financial Data Processing:**

* **Extraction:** Data will be extracted from the identified sources using APIs, web scraping, or direct database connections. Automated scripts will be implemented for regular data updates. Data validation checks will be performed to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
* **Cleaning and Transformation:** Raw data will be cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data will be transformed into a standardized format suitable for analysis and calculations. This includes adjusting for stock splits and dividends.
* **Storage:** Processed data will be stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for efficient querying and retrieval.  A time-series database may be considered for optimizing historical market data access.


**3. Financial Ratio Calculation:**

The system will calculate the following key financial ratios:

* **Profitability Ratios:** Gross Profit Margin, Net Profit Margin, Return on Equity (ROE), Return on Assets (ROA).
* **Liquidity Ratios:** Current Ratio, Quick Ratio.
* **Solvency Ratios:** Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Debt-to-Asset Ratio.
* **Valuation Ratios:** Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E), Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B), Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S).

The formulas for each ratio will be implemented based on standard financial definitions. The system will use the processed financial statement data to calculate these ratios.


**4. Sentiment Analysis:**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Text data from news articles and social media will be preprocessed by removing irrelevant characters, stop words, and performing stemming/lemmatization.
* **Sentiment Scoring:**  A pre-trained sentiment analysis model (e.g., VADER, BERT) or a cloud-based sentiment analysis API (e.g., Google Cloud Natural Language API, Amazon Comprehend) will be used to assign sentiment scores to each piece of text.  Scores will range from negative to positive, reflecting the overall sentiment expressed.
* **Aggregation:** Sentiment scores will be aggregated over time and across different sources to provide an overall sentiment indicator for each stock.


**5. Recommendation Logic:**

The recommendation engine will combine quantitative and qualitative analysis to generate recommendations:

* **Quantitative Analysis:**  Financial ratios, historical stock performance, and projected earnings growth will be analyzed. Weighted scoring based on predefined thresholds will be used to evaluate the financial health and potential of each stock.
* **Qualitative Analysis:** Sentiment scores derived from news and social media will be incorporated into the overall score.
* **Recommendation Generation:** Based on the combined score, the system will generate one of the following recommendations:
    * **Buy:**  A strong positive outlook based on both quantitative and qualitative factors.
    * **Hold:** A neutral outlook, suggesting maintaining the current position.
    * **Sell:** A negative outlook, indicating potential downside risk.
* **Risk Tolerance:** User profiles will include risk tolerance levels (e.g., conservative, moderate, aggressive). The recommendation logic will adjust based on the user's risk profile.


**6. User Interface:**

* **Dashboard:** A central dashboard will display an overview of the user's portfolio, including current holdings, performance, and recommendations.
* **Stock Search:** Users can search for specific stocks and view detailed information, including financial ratios, historical performance, news sentiment, and the system's recommendation.
* **Portfolio Management:** Users can add/remove stocks from their portfolio and adjust their holdings.
* **Alerts:** Customizable alerts will notify users of significant price changes, news events, and changes in recommendations.
* **Visualization:** Charts and graphs will be used to visualize stock performance, financial ratios, and sentiment trends.
* **User Profile:** Users can set their risk tolerance, investment goals, and notification preferences.


This document outlines the key requirements for the stock recommendation system. Further details will be elaborated in subsequent design and development phases.
