  "best_prompt": "To generate a complete Requirement Analysis, let\u2019s break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Identify key data sources for the system.\nStep 2: Describe how financial data is extracted and processed.\nStep 3: Explain how financial ratios are computed.\nStep 4: Detail how sentiment analysis is applied.\nStep 5: Describe the recommendation logic for Buy, Hold, and Sell.\nStep 6: Define the user interface and expected user interactions.\n\nNow, generate a structured Requirement Analysis using this step-by-step approach.",
  "reasoning": "The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy provides significantly better structure and more comprehensive output compared to the zero-shot and few-shot prompts. By breaking down the task into smaller, manageable steps, the CoT prompt guides the model to think through each aspect of the requirement analysis systematically. This leads to a more organized and complete output covering data sources, processing, analysis, recommendation logic, and user interface considerations. The zero-shot and few-shot prompts, while generating reasonable responses, lack the level of detail and organization provided by the CoT approach.  Among the CoT prompts, the ones with lower temperatures (0.3) were slightly more concise and focused, but the core content remained consistent across different temperature settings.",
