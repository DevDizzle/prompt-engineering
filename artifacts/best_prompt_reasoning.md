# Best Prompt Selection Reasoning

## Best Prompt
To generate a complete Requirement Analysis, letâ€™s break it down step by step:

Step 1: Identify key data sources for the system.
Step 2: Describe how financial data is extracted and processed.
Step 3: Explain how financial ratios are computed.
Step 4: Detail how sentiment analysis is applied.
Step 5: Describe the recommendation logic for Buy, Hold, and Sell.
Step 6: Define the user interface and expected user interactions.

Now, generate a structured Requirement Analysis using this step-by-step approach.

## Reasoning
The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy provides significantly better structure and more comprehensive output compared to the zero-shot and few-shot prompts. By breaking down the task into smaller, manageable steps, the CoT prompt guides the model to think through each aspect of the requirement analysis systematically. This leads to a more organized and complete output covering data sources, processing, analysis, recommendation logic, and user interface considerations. The zero-shot and few-shot prompts, while generating reasonable responses, lack the level of detail and organization provided by the CoT approach.  Among the CoT prompts, the ones with lower temperatures (0.3) were slightly more concise and focused, but the core content remained consistent across different temperature settings.

## Refined Prompt
Generate a comprehensive Requirement Analysis document using the following structured approach:

1. Data Sources: Identify all key data sources the system will utilize.
2. Financial Data Processing: Describe the extraction and processing of financial data.
3. Financial Ratio Calculation: Explain how key financial ratios are computed.
4. Sentiment Analysis: Detail the application of sentiment analysis.
5. Recommendation Logic: Describe the logic behind Buy, Hold, and Sell recommendations.
6. User Interface: Define the user interface and expected user interactions.
